I love scripting, automation and optimization. But before that you can read previous experience:</p><h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2><p>When I was at most 2 or 3 years old, in 2000, or maybe 2001, the first computer I saw was a nice shiny white case with a super-duper white CRT, powered by a Windows 98 + standalone MS-DOS dual boot. It had a Pentium 2 CPU, 32 MB RAM, and no graphics card. Before I even learned to walk or write with a pen, I started learning about computers. There was a DOS game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince of Persia</a>. But as a noob player, I only beat this game with cheats.</p><pre><code>cd C:
cd PROGRAM FILES 
cd PRINCE
PRINCE.EXE MEGAHIT
C:\PROGRAM FILES\PRINCE\PRINCE.EXE MEGAHIT
</code></pre><p>Here’s the first introduction to the command line interface to a 2-year-old boy. Because that was what my father did. I learned:</p><ul><li>How to change directory</li><li>How to execute a binary file</li><li>Add execute parameters to binary file</li><li>Feel like a king while i was cheating through whole game (<em>presses arrow keys and space key furiously</em>)</li></ul><p>But still, it is not a knowledge, instead, it is experience. It was “how to cheat this game”, not “how to change directory” nor “how to append parameter to execution”</p><h2 id="going-unix">Going UNIX</h2><p>Another moment when I delved deeper into the computer started when I tried to set up a game server at computer lab at my middle school in 2009 or 2010, i think. Stupid game but I loved it: <a href="https://gameforge.com/en-US/play/metin2">Metin2</a>.</p><p>I-EVEN-DO-NOT-KNOW-EVERY-SINGLE-THING… in FreeBSD 4.3-or-whatever-archaic-version-has in virtual machine amalgamation of <a href="https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Virtual_PC">Microsoft Virtual PC</a>. I just booted up the VM, logged in, did some tcp things, copy-pasted something like</p><pre><code>/etc/rc.d/netif restart
</code></pre><p>or stupidly break all virtual machine and restart all building that VM again when something went wrong. But that was…something that gives a lot of experience. The idea of playing the game you play online on your own computer in local LAN and sharing this game server with your friends was a great idea.</p><p>I was also exposed to MySQL a little bit. I learned</p><ul><li>What is a database</li><li>“<a href="https://navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-mysql">Navicating</a>“ through database (nice workbench btw., DBeaver still has a lot to do)</li><li>What is normalization</li><li>Why my character name is not in the database</li><li>Why my character is 000001</li><li>Why my sword name is not in the database</li><li>But every My Super Sword as 18300 id on it</li><li>Why I just can not change my Super Sword +0 to +9 graphically</li><li>But when I changed its 18309, it magically turned into My Super Sword +9</li><li>But only 000001’s 18309 sword, not 000002’s 18309…</li></ul><p>Again, it still is not a knowledge, instead, it is experience.</p><h2 id="time-for-linux">Time for Linux</h2><p>There comes a time when everyone is rebellious. Especially during adolescence. This was also developed on the open source side for me. And of course that was nice combo: I was a student and broke. My laptop was crying. Get out Microsoft! Long live Stallman and Torvalds! Needed a change.</p><p>Starting high school, in 2012, Ubuntu was my first distro to launch in my system, natively, without virtualization. I was in chaos. Nothing is same as Windows. “Why .exe’s won’t work?”, Why there’s no classic Start Menu or Settings Panel etc.” Even I was <em>power user</em> on Windows, a.k.a. “the IT guy” in primary school or high school, i felt FOMO, I needed to learn from scratch. But still, I was newbie Linux user until 2016-2017. I only used LibreOffice, tried a couple of Windows programs on Wine, tried open source games: TuxKart, OpenArena etc., looked into app store… Even the goverment that time encourages Linux in high school systems (it didn’t work anyway), so whenever there’s a Linux talk, I hopped into there.</p><p>I have had some experience with Python. I still quit after doing the first 5-6 lessons.</p><p>Third time, again: it is not a knowledge, instead, it is experience.</p><h2 id="then-theres-knowledge">Then There’s Knowledge</h2><p>When I started university in 2017, I had to downgrade my gaming rig to cheap laptop for portability. Then I took a big, serious step: using Arch Linux. With this action, it was starting to reveal the first sparks of my workflow that allowed me to gain not only experience but also knowledge. I riced my PC from <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/base-devel/"><em>base-devel</em></a> to <em>fancy X11 window manager</em>, stunning enough to post it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">/r/unixporn</a>. I was also obsessed with minimalism: <em>KISS, suckless, UNIX philosophy, Do One Thing Well, minimal RAM consumption…</em> Throughout this time, I learned basic operations of GNU Coreutils, vim, skeleton of Linux, various daily life command line utilities (curl, youtube-downloader, document convertor, p7-zip etc.), learned how to learn with manual pages.</p><p>The things I learned back then still allow me to easily know my way around Linux today.</p><h2 id="into-the-my-first-real-script">Into the my first real script</h2><p>A couple years ago (2022) I automated <a href="https://www.dragonfable.com/">DragonFable</a>‘s GUI with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AHK</a> script… and I mesmerized. <strong>DUDE!!! WHAT A NICE THING I HAVE DONE.</strong> It would be at least hunderds hours of grinding manually, but, <strong>with script, it took less than 6 hours! Also there’s no need to stay in front of monitor…</strong> If you know, you know… You need to grind 2256 times to get that throphy. Yeah, I tasted the posion, which covers my whole body - finally. That was the first, meaningful spark of my getting into tech job.</p><p>I also use Linux but there’s no AHK equivalent in there. I used to deal with MS-DOS Batch, Shell BASH scripting, but not an extensive, a real-deal programming language. So, <em>hello darkness my old friend</em> = Python. It’s time to learn Python?</p><p>But it actually not. I just learned how to write within pre-set library: <em>pyAutoGUI</em> and <em>time</em>. I didn’t learn Python fully. But as I said before, it sparked something.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2><p>I said enough is enough. I have been involved with computers since I was born, but I do not have a computer-related profession. I kept researching how I could do this during my military service in 2023, and now I am taking my first concrete steps in 2024.</p><p>You can see my progress <a href="/my-devops-journey.html">by clicking this link: My DevOps Journey</a></p><p>So, here I am.
